## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Torrowdawn, or *Chenxia Tang* here. 

I was born in 2003, and I'm currently a Master student in [USTC-INT](https://int-ustc.github.io/). My main research interest is deep learning, with a particular focus on pre-training and high-speed inference. I agree with Euripides: *The language of truth is simple*.

My favorite Top-2 English words are *Meditation* and *Philosophy*. I treat meditation as the best medicine for life, and I also deeply love wisdom. 

### ðŸ’» Skills

I am highly proficient in 

- Python ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
- C++ ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

which you can verify from my repos. I also wrote `verilog`, and planning to learn dart to develop some android apps.

### ðŸ”¬ Research Interests

I have dabbled in

- Reinforcement Learning
- Recommendation System
- Large Language Model

My research on large language models is particularly **in-depth**. For example, I can recite the runtime of almost all operations during the execution of LLaMA.
