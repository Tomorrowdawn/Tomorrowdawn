Torrowdawn, or *Chenxia Tang* here. 

I was born in 2003, and I'm currently a Master student in [USTC-INT](https://int-ustc.github.io/). My main research interest is deep learning, with a particular focus on pre-training and high-speed inference. I agree with Euripides: 'The language of truth is simple'. I believe that good AI must consist of a powerful foundation model combined with sufficiently fast processing speed. 

I am highly proficient in Python and C++, which you can verify from my repositories. Recently, I've been planning to learn a bit of Dart to develop some personal apps.

I have dabbled in reinforcement learning, recommendation systems, and large language models. My research on large language models is particularly in-depth. For example, I can recite the runtime of almost all operations during the execution of LLaMA.

My habbits are animation, Go(board game), philosophy and writing. Top-2 English words of mine are *Meditation* and *Philosophy*. I treat meditation as the best medicine for life, and I also deeply love wisdom.
